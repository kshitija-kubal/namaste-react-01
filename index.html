    <!-- Order of files should be in this sequence
     First, import React package and then only import App.js
     Otherwise, it will throw error - "React is not defined" -->
     <h1>This is a H1 Tag above root div</h1>
    <div id="root">
        <!-- Content inside div tag with ID - root will get replaced by content defined inside
         App.js - Why ?
         When Browser reads html file, it comes from top, it reads div tag with ID root, renders h1 tag inside it,
         then it reads React file -> ReachDOM Element and then App.js, which in turn replaces h1 tag defined here with
         tags defined inside App.js
          -->
        <h1>Root H1 Tag</h1>
    </div>
    <!-- Tags defined above and below root tag won't get affected and will be rendered.
     Because they are not defined inside App.js file
     If we define the, in App.js, they will to get replaced. -->
    <h1>This is a H1 Tag below root div</h1>
    <!-- What is cross origin ? -->
     <!-- What if we don't defined id in div tag -->
